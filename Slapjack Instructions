SLAPJACK

INSTRUCTIONS
Deal cards one at a time face down to each player until all the cards have been dealt. 
The hands do not have to come out even. 
Without looking at any of the cards players put their cards in a neat pile in front of them
The person to the left of the dealer goes first and then it goes clockwise.
Each player lifts one card at a time from their pile and places it face up in the center of the table.
When the card played to the center is a jack, the first player to slap the jack takes the jack and all the cards beneath it.
The player who slapped the jack turns them face down, shuffles them, and adds it to their pile of cards.
When more than one player slaps at a jack, the one whose hand is directly on top of the jack wins the pile.
If a player slaps at any card in the center that is not a jack, they must give put one card under the pile.
When a player has no more cards left, they are out.
The player who is left at the end is the winner.
